            <p>goal orientation, or achievement orientation, is an "individual disposition towards developing or validating one's ability in achievement settings".
            [1] In general, an individual can be said to be mastery or performance oriented, based on whether one's goal is to develop one's ability or to demonstrate
            one's ability, respectively.[2] A mastery orientation is also sometimes referred to as a learning orientation. </p>

            <p>Goal orientation refers to how an individual interprets and reacts to tasks, resulting in different patterns of cognition, affect and behavior.
            [3] Developed within a social-cognitive framework, the orientation goal theory proposes that students' motivation and achievement-related behaviors 
            can be understood by considering the reasons or purposes they adopt while engaged in academic work.[4] The focus is on how students think about 
            hemselves, their tasks, and their performance.[5] Goal orientations have been shown to be associated with individuals' academic achievement, 
            adjustment, and well-being.[6][7][8] </p>

            <p> Research has examined goal orientation as a motivation variable that is useful for recruitment, climate and culture, performance appraisal, 
            and choice.[9][10] It has also been used to predict sales performance, adaptive performance,[11] goal setting, learning and adaptive behaviors 
            in training, and leadership.[9] </p>
