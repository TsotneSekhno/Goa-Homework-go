        <h3>Components and conceptualizations</h3>
            <p>There are multiple conceptualizations and operationalizations of goal orientation. Dweck's initial research suggested 
            two component of goal orientation, learning orientation or performance orientation which was assessed in children based on 
            task preference. Later research by Elliot and VandeWalle suggested a three factor model. Vandewalle's research suggested three 
            factors learning, avoiding poor performance, and demonstrating good performance. Concurrently, Elliot developed a model of goal 
            orientation in terms of avoiding poor outcomes vs achieving good outcomes and mastery vs performance which improved measures of
            intrinsic motivation and suggested a three factor model: mastery achievement, performance-approach and performance-avoid.[19]</p>
        <h4>Two factor model</h4>
            <p>Dweck proposed that there are two types of goal orientation: mastery orientation and performance orientation.[20] Dweck postulated 
            that children with learning goals were believed to approach situations to master the acquisition of new skills, while children with performance
            goals were believed to approach situations to gain approval from peers and teachers. Like Eison, Dweck conceptualized goal orientation as a 
            two-dimension construct. Individuals with a mastery orientation seek to develop their competence by acquiring new skills and mastering new situations.
            [20] They are not concerned about their performance relative to others, but rather with furthering their understanding of a given topic or task.
            [21] Individuals with a performance orientation seek to demonstrate and validate the adequacy of their competence to receive favorable compliments 
            while avoiding negative judgments. Although Dweck's work in this area built on the foundation laid by Nicholls, the fundamental difference between 
            the two scholars' works is the attribution of an individual's goal orientation: Nicholls believed that the goal orientation held by an individual was 
            a result of the possession of either an internal or external referent[definition needed], while Dweck considered the adoption of a particular goal 
            orientation to be related to the theory of intelligence held by that individual. </p>
            <p> Subsequent work by Eison and colleagues in 1982 led to a change in the conceptualization of these orientations from two ends of a continuum to two 
            separate constructs.[22] More recently, researchers have embraced the idea that individuals can adopt the two orientation styles simultaneously: individuals
            can be independently high or low in learning and performance orientations. Ultimately, they can entertain multiple competing goal orientations at the same time,
            and strive to both outperform competitors and improve their performance. This line of thinking led to the conceptualization of two separate continua: one for mastery 
            orientation and one for performance orientation.[23]</p>
