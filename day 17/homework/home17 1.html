        <h2>History</h2>
            <p> Research on achievement motivation can be traced back to the 1940s following the seminal work of David
            McClelland and colleagues who established the link between achievement and motivations (see need for achievement).
            Students' goal orientations were shown to be predictive of academic performance. Specifically, students with high
            goal orientation tended to value competence, expect success and seek challenges, while students with low achievement 
            motivation tended to expect failure and avoid challenges.[12] </p>

            <p>Conceptualizations of goal orientation were proposed in the 1970s by educational psychologist Eison. Eison argued 
            that students who attended college as an opportunity to acquire new skills and knowledge possessed a mastery orientation 
            (which he referred to as learning orientation), while students who attended college to exclusively obtain high grades 
            possessed a grade orientation.[15] Eison originally believed that these two orientations were two ends of the same 
            continuum and developed the Learning Orientation-Grade Orientation Scale to measure it. </p>

            <p> Meanwhile, Nicholls was developing a related theory that goal motivation would lead grade school children to set high
            task-related goals.[16][17][18] Nicholls found that some high-ability children would use maladaptive strategies when they 
            encountered difficult tasks, which led to eventual feelings of helplessness.[16] By contrast, others would use more productive 
            coping strategies to avoid helplessness. Nicholls later conceptualized these differences as two types of achievement goals: task 
            involvement, where individuals seek to develop their competence relative to their abilities, and ego involvement, where individuals 
            seek to develop their competence relative to the abilities of others.[16] Nicholls' early work set the stage for Carol Dweck's work.</p>
