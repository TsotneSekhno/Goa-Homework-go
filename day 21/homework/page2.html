        <h2> Background</h2>
        <p>Before bitcoin, several digital cash technologies were released, starting with David Chaum's ecash in 
        the 1980s.[11] The idea that solutions to computational puzzles could have some value was 
        first proposed by cryptographers Cynthia Dwork and Moni Naor in 1992.[11] The concept was independently
        rediscovered by Adam Back who developed Hashcash, a proof-of-work scheme for spam control in 1997.[11] 
        The first proposals for distributed digital scarcity-based cryptocurrencies came from cypherpunks Wei Dai
        (b-money) and Nick Szabo (bit gold) in 1998.[12] In 2004, Hal Finney developed the first currency based
        on reusable proof of work.[13] These various attempts were not successful:[11] Chaum's concept required 
        centralized control and no banks wanted to sign on, Hashcash had no protection against double-spending, 
        while b-money and bit gold were not resistant to Sybil attacks.[11] </p>
