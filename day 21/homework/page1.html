           <p style="color: chartreuse;">Bitcoin uses peer-to-peer technology to operate with no central authority or banks;
        managing transactions and the issuing of bitcoins is carried out collectively by the network. 
        Bitcoin is open-source; its design is public, nobody owns or controls Bitcoin and everyone can take part.</p>

          <p> Bitcoin (abbreviation: BTC; sign: â‚¿) is the first decentralized cryptocurrency. Nodes in the peer-to-peer 
            bitcoin network verify transactions through cryptography and record them in a public distributed ledger, 
            called a blockchain,
            without central oversight. Consensus between nodes is achieved using a computationally intensive 
            process based on proof of work, called mining, that guarantees the security of the bitcoin blockchain.
            Mining consumes large quantities of electricity and has been criticized for its environmental effects.[5]  </p>
