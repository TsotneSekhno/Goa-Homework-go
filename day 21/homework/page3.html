        <p>The domain name bitcoin.org was registered on 18 August 2008.[14] On 31 October 2008,
             a link to a white paper authored by Satoshi Nakamoto titled Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer
              Electronic Cash System was posted to a cryptography mailing list.[15] Nakamoto
              implemented the bitcoin software as open-source code and released it in January 2009.
              [7] Nakamoto's identity remains unknown.[6] All individual components of bitcoin 
              originated in earlier academic literature.[11] Nakamoto's innovation was their complex
               interplay resulting in the first decentralized, Sybil resistant, Byzantine fault tolerant
                digital cash system, that would eventually be referred to as the first blockchain.[11][16]
                Nakamoto's paper was not peer reviewed and was initially ignored by academics, who argued
                 that it could not work.[11]

            On 3 January 2009, the bitcoin network was created when Nakamoto mined the starting block of the 
            chain, known as the genesis block.[17] Embedded in this block was the text "The Times 03/Jan/2009
             Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks", which is the date and headline of an issue of
              The Times newspaper.[7] Nine days later, Hal Finney received the first bitcoin transaction: ten 
              bitcoins from Nakamoto.[18] Wei Dai and Nick Szabo were also early supporters.[17] On May 22, 2010,
               the first known commercial transaction using bitcoin occurred when programmer Laszlo Hanyecz bough
               t two Papa John's pizzas for â‚¿10,000, in what would later be celebrated as "Bitcoin Pizza Day".[19]
